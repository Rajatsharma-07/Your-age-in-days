# Your-age-in-days

Hello guys! Here I made a basic Javascript project which helps us calculating our age in days. I used Html for a basic layout, Css for some styling and Ofcourse Javascript functions
to calculate our age.
I made a function which takes our birth year as a variable using prompt and then subtracting birth year from our current year and multiplying the result to 365 to get our age in
days.
